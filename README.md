# Hangman
A CLI implemented Hangman game.
For Project 09 of Nand2Tetris Part 2, by Exkywor.

## The Game
The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word, from a selected set of words, by guessing one letter contained in the word at a time before running out of attempts.
The number of attempts will be decided based on the length of the word and the selected difficulty.

## How To Play
Download the [Nand2Tetris Software Suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software), then launch the VM Emulator contained in it. Once open, load the Hangman folder, set the animation to "No animation", and click "Run".

You'll be prompted to start the game, select a word set, and a difficulty. With that done, start guessing!
